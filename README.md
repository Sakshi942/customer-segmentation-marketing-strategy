# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation and Personalized Marketing Strategy

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on segmenting customers based on their purchasing behavior using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and clustering techniques. The insights are used to create personalized marketing strategies and visually communicate them through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

## 🎯 Objective

- Identify customer segments using data-driven techniques.
- Recommend targeted marketing strategies based on customer profiles.
- Visualize segment-wise insights for better business decision-making.

2. **Average RFM Scores by Customer Cluster**  
   Bar chart comparing average Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values across clusters.

3. **Customer Details Table**  
   A detailed view of each customer with their RFM values, cluster, segment, and strategy.

4. **Marketing Strategy Breakdown**  
   Treemap chart showing customer count per assigned marketing strategy.
